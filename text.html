<h1>The Six Systems That Help Product Teams Thrive</h1>
<h2>Why band-aid solutions fail product teams</h2>
<p>“We <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-283-just-and-but">just</a> need to implement RACI charts," the engineering director insisted. "That will fix our collaboration problems."</p>
<p>“Once everyone is trained on using RICE, prioritization will be less of a battle.”</p>
<p>“Can’t we simply establish a stage-gate process to move products from ideation to release with more clarity?”</p>
<p>I've heard variations of this countless times. When product teams struggle, the instinct is to reach for ready-made solutions – frameworks, processes, methodologies. These band-aid fixes promise quick results. They're comforting. They're also usually wrong for that <span class="ai-text" data-testid="ai-text">company's</span> particular situation.</p>
<p>After a decade of transforming product organizations, I've learned that lasting excellence isn't built through frameworks. It comes from understanding the deeper systems that shape how your team actually works.</p>
<p>Through my work transforming product organizations, I've identified six critical systems that determine a team's success:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Infrastructure - The foundation that enables effective work</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Self-Improvement - The ability to evolve and adapt</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Human Connection - The relationships that drive innovation</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Decision Frameworks - The structures that enable clear choices</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Strategic Focus - The capacity to work on what matters most</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Customer Centricity - The systems for staying focused on user needs</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding and strengthening these systems – rather than reaching for quick fixes – is what truly transforms product teams. Here's how each system works, why it matters, and how to build it:</p>

<h2>Build Infrastructure Beyond Tools</h2>
<p>"We just need a better roadmapping tool." Sound familiar? Yet I’ve seen too many teams implement new tools<span class="ai-text" data-testid="ai-text"> and </span>see no meaningful improvement in their performance (or even use of the tool). It takes more than a tool to change your <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-culture/">product culture</a>.</p>

<h3>The Hidden Cost of Tool-First Thinking</h3>
<p>I would love it if operational challenges could be solved with the right software. But when teams focus too much on tools, they create new problems: low adoption, inconsistent usage, and ultimately, wasted investment. The real transformation happens when tools are just one piece of a larger infrastructure system, building up to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-culture-blueprint/">vision of what the ideal culture looks like</a>.</p>

<h3>The Infrastructure Rule of Threes</h3>
<p>Influential product leaders follow a simple but powerful principle to change team behavior: implement at least <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-infrastructure/">three different types of infrastructure</a> for any meaningful change. This could include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Tools (software solutions)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Documentation (guides and templates)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Training (skill development)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Meetings (structured collaboration)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Automation (connecting systems)</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was at SpotHero, we transformed our A/B testing practices not just by implementing a new tool, but by creating templates, establishing weekly review meetings, and documenting best practices. This layered approach made the change stick.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Audit your current infrastructure mix - are you over-reliant on tools?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/building-business-cases-that-leadership-cant-ignore/">Make sure you have a clear objective you’re trying to achieve if you decide to use a tool</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>For your next initiative, plan three different types of supporting infrastructure</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Focus on making desired behaviors the easiest path forward</p>
	</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2>Design for Self-Improvement</h2>
<p>When product teams struggle, leaders often rush to implement solutions. But what if your team already knows what needs to change - they just need the right environment to make it happen?</p>

<h3>Leading from the bottom up</h3>
<p>Product leaders don't have time to drive every change themselves. Instead, they create conditions where teams naturally evolve and improve. (Though <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/influencing-product-managers/">convincing product managers to change</a> isn’t always easy)</p>
<p>Giving teams autonomy to choose how they work creates more buy-in and enthusiasm for change than if the change is imposed from the top down.</p>

<h3>The Three Rituals of Excellence</h3>
<p>Collaborative teams consistently practice <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/rituals-of-a-self-improving-team/">three key ceremonies</a> that drive continuous improvement:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Retrospectives: Regular team reflection on processes</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Premortems: Anticipating challenges before they occur</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Business Reviews: Evaluating real impact on goals</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>One team I worked with was struggling with documentation. Rather than mandate new processes, we implemented these rituals. Within weeks, the team independently identified their documentation gaps and designed their own solutions - with higher adoption than any top-down approach.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Schedule your first retrospective - but resist the urge to lead it</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Choose one upcoming initiative for a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/premortems-guide/">premortem</a> exercise</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Block time for regular business impact reviews</p>
	</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2>Prioritize Human Connection</h2>
<p>I keep seeing teams rush to adopt AI and automation tools, hoping they'll magically solve collaboration problems. But here's what I've learned after a decade of working with product teams: our most powerful advantage isn't in AI usage – it's in our relationships.</p>

<h3>The AI-ification Trap</h3>
<p>The rush to AI-ify everything creates a dangerous temptation: replacing human connection with synthetic efficiency. When you let AI handle too much of the relationship work, you risk building products that feel technically sound but emotionally hollow.</p>
<p>Don't mistake efficiency for effectiveness. Moving faster through user research or stakeholder communication might seem productive, but it often means missing the insights that only come from genuine human interaction.</p>

<h3>The Power of Direct Connection</h3>
<p>I like to see product teams maintaining strong human connections in three critical areas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Customer Relationships: Direct conversations that build true empathy</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-hub/">Team Collaboration</a>: Real-time problem-solving that sparks innovation</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/release-calendar/">Stakeholder Communication</a>: Authentic partnerships that drive alignment</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>One food delivery company <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/customer-obsession/">made this real</a> by requiring every employee - including product managers - to make actual deliveries. This first-hand experience created insights and empathy that no amount of data analysis could replicate. That’s a strong example of building <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-infrastructure/">infrastructure</a> that goes beyond tools.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Use AI to identify opportunities for meaningful customer conversations, but conduct the conversations yourself</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Let automation handle meeting scheduling and notes, freeing up energy for deeper customer relationships</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Create space for "active processing" time where your team can discuss and internalize what they're learning from customers</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Create Clear Decision Frameworks</h2>
<p>"We need to implement RACI charts," the engineering director insisted. But after a decade of transforming product organizations, I've learned that decision frameworks need to address three key questions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>How should we structure our teams to make decisions?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>What processes will enable those decisions?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>How do we keep decisions aligned with our strategy?</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Team Structure Decisions</h3>
<p>The first framework every organization needs is how to structure their shared product operations work, especially if they <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-ops-without-headcount/">don’t want to dedicate headcount</a> to it. I've seen three patterns emerge:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Leadership-owned: Product leaders maintain decision rights and delegate selectively</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Rotational system: Decision ownership rotates among team members to build broader perspective</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Management training: Rising leaders are given increasing decision authority as part of growth</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Each model has its place. For example, leadership-owned works well in turnaround situations, while rotational systems excel in stable, mature organizations.</p>

<h3>Process-Level Decisions</h3>
<p>Once you have your structure, you need frameworks for day-to-day decisions. Traditional tools like RACI charts potentially help with specific projects, but are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/raci-charts-are-stifling-collaboration/">likely to create issues</a> on teams. I prefer more flexible approaches:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Single Accountable Individual (DRI): Clear ownership with collaborative input</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Decision-Focused Frameworks: Tools like RAPID that focus on choices rather than roles</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Strategy-Driven Collaboration: Teams organize around outcomes rather than roles, allowing people to contribute wherever they can add value</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is matching your framework to the situation. For short-term projects with external stakeholders, traditional frameworks can work. For ongoing product development, you need something that encourages the team to have deeper collaboration.</p>

		<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/process-maps/">Map</a> your current decision points and team structure</p>

		<p>Choose an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-operations-team-model/">operating model</a> that matches your organization's maturity and needs</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Start small, measure impact, and scale what works</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Enable Strategic Focus</h2>
<p>Your product managers want to be strategic, but they're stuck in back-to-back meetings and overwhelmed with administrative tasks. “Do it all" product management never really worked. But we can help the product managers on our team get closer to it.</p>

<h3>The Meeting Trap</h3>
<p>In one enterprise, product managers spent 29% of their time in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/meeting-audit/">recurring meetings</a> (and that’s lower than some other companies I’ve seen). Fixing meetings helped product managers focus on the strategic work that mattered. It also opened the door to completely reimagine communication and alignment flows with the go-to-market teams.</p>
<p>The improved communications naturally resolved some of the tensions in the org, reducing the amount of stakeholder alignment work PMs had to do.</p>

<h3>Creating Space for Strategy</h3>
<p>High-performing organizations build three key elements into their operational foundation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-ops-strategy-stack/">Clear Strategic Support</a>: Product operations designed to support your product strategy</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/meeting-audit/">Meeting audits</a>: Systematic reduction of unnecessary meetings</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/becoming-the-product-manager-they-always-dreamed-of/">Operational Support</a>: AI and systems that handle routine tasks</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>When that enterprise team conducted a meeting audit, they didn't just free up time – they created space for strategic thinking and stronger collaboration. The key was pairing time savings with clear strategic direction. Nowadays, I encourage product leaders to take that even further with AI tooling support.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Build a baseline by tracking where your product managers' time goes today</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Identify a few key strategic activities you want them doing more</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Create infrastructure (tools, processes, automation) that protects time for those activities</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Measure the impact - are PMs actually spending more time on strategic work?</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Design for Customer Centricity</h2>
<p>"Our team is customer-obsessed," leaders often claim. But many companies actually make it harder for product to connect with customers. How can we build a customer-centric company, and what role should AI play in that today?</p>

<h3>The Customer Connection Crisis</h3>
<p>Many teams rely on filtered customer feedback – through analytics, support tickets, or sales reports. Others are exploring <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/what-ai-shouldntdo/">synthetic user research using AI</a>. But great products come from deep customer understanding that only direct connection can provide. Without the right infrastructure to enable this connection, "customer-centric" becomes an empty phrase.</p>

<h3>Building Customer Connection</h3>
<p>At SpotHero, we created multiple pieces of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-infrastructure/">infrastructure</a> around three key areas that made customer-centricity real:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Easy Access: Every employee could look up any customer's contact information and reach out directly</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Shared Experience: New employees worked customer support during their first few weeks</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Connected Systems: Support tickets, analytics, and customer feedback were integrated for a complete view</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The result? Product managers regularly reached out to users, understood their challenges deeply, and made better decisions. More importantly, the entire company developed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/customer-obsession/">genuine empathy</a> for our customers.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Audit how easy it is for PMs to contact customers</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Create a system for sharing customer insights</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Find ways for teams to experience your product as customers do</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Build Your High-Performing Product Team</h2>
<p>Here's what I've learned after working with dozens of product teams: excellence isn't about having the perfect tool or process. It's about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jennywanger.com/articles/product-culture/">building systems</a> that reinforce each other.</p>
<p>Think about the product teams you admire. They don't just have great roadmap tools – they have infrastructure that makes roadmapping easy. They don't just do customer research – they have systems that make customer contact natural. They don't just make good decisions – they have frameworks that enable collaboration.</p>
<p>Each system we've explored - Infrastructure, Self-Improvement, Human Connection, Decision Frameworks, Strategic Focus, and Customer Centricity - plays a crucial role. But you don't need to tackle them all at once.</p>
<p>Start with your biggest pain point. Then:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p>Look for quick wins that could make it better tomorrow</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Layer in supporting infrastructure beyond just tools</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Measure whether it's actually helping your team</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Build on what works, learn from what doesn't</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’d like to talk about how to approach this, please reach out. I’m always happy to have a complimentary consult to help get you unblocked as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Remember: struggling teams keep adding processes hoping something will stick. Thriving teams build systems that make excellence the path of least resistance.</p>

<h1>Work with Jenny</h1>
<p>These concepts perfectly illustrate why my approach to product operations consulting goes beyond quick fixes. When product leaders come to me struggling with team performance, they often want to implement the latest framework or methodology – just like the examples you mentioned. But lasting transformation requires a deeper understanding of the systems that actually drive success.</p>
<p><strong>My services are specifically designed to strengthen these six critical systems within your organization.</strong> Through my Product Operations Assessment, we identify which of these systems are weak or missing in your current setup. My 1:1 Product Operations Coaching helps you develop the leadership skills to build and maintain these systems effectively. And my Product Operations Consulting provides hands-on implementation support to establish the infrastructure, decision frameworks, and strategic focus your team needs to thrive.</p>
<p>Rather than applying generic solutions, I work with you to understand your team's unique challenges and build customized systems that address your specific context. This is why my clients see lasting change – we're not just implementing another framework, we're transforming the underlying systems that determine whether your product team operates at their full potential or continues to struggle with the same recurring problems.</p>
